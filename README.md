# FEM_nonlinear_f90

Non-Linear FEM code, written in fortran90. Based on the Positional Finite Element Method. Theres 2 different codes, one for the static analysis and other for the dynamical analysis. 

The static code also has the implementation of the Phase-Field method for fracture, with the Vol-Dev split.

Solver SUPERLU, sparse matrix and OpenMP implementations.

The code reads a 2D mesh in a specefic format.
 - Allows for linear, quadratic and cubic approximations.
 - It allows for particles generations inside the global mesh. The particles then contribute to the stiffness of the elements where they are placed. The particle generation is ramdom.
 - After the solution, it outputs 2 different files, one which can be viewed with AcadView (Visualization software from SET-EESC, University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) )
